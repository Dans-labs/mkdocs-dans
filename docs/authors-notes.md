# Author's notes

## Hi, I'm Martin ([@squidfunk][1])

I'm a freelance polyglot software engineer and entrepreneur from Cologne,
Germany with more than 12 years of experience in full-stack web development and
system programming.

## Why another theme?

Some time ago I wanted to release a project to the open, but it was in need of
user documentation. I checked out the available tools and stuck with MkDocs,
because it was so simple and easy to use. However, none of the available
themes convinced me.

I wanted to build something that was usable on all screen sizes from the ground
up, something beautiful and practical at the same time. Google's Material Design
appeared to be the perfect fit and this something became Material, a Material
Design theme for MkDocs.

## And I am Dirk Roorda ([dirkroorda][2])

For more or less the same reasons I arrived at MkDocs, and my reason for
customising Martin's Material theme is the need to apply the web styles of our
institute ([DANS][3])
