# Compliance with GDPR

## Material does not process any personal data

Material is a theme for MkDocs, a static site generator. In itself, Material
does not perform any tracking or processing of personal data. However, some of
the third-party services that Material integrates with may actually be in breach
with the [General Data Protection Regulation][1] (GDPR) and need to be evaluated
carefully.
