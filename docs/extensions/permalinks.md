# Permalinks

Permalinks are a feature of the [Table of Contents][1] extension, which is part
of the standard Markdown library. The extension inserts an anchor at the end of
each headline, which makes it possible to directly link to a subpart of the
document.

## Usage

When enabled, permalinks are inserted automatically.
