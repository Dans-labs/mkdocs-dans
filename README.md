Customisation of the
[mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
theme to the DANS theme.

With special thanks to Martin Donath who created the `mkdocs-material` theme
in such a way that others can make their own customization of it.
This is such a customization.

Read the
[docs](https://dans-labs.github.io/mkdocs-dans/)
about this theme and what you can do with the underlying "Material" theme.
